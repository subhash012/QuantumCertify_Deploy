# QuantumCertify Railway Deployment - Healthcheck Fix

## Issues Identified from Logs

From the Railway deployment logs, the build was successful but the application failed healthcheck because:

1. **ODBC Driver Version Mismatch**: The application expected "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server" but Railway installed "ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server"
2. **Potential startup errors**: The app wasn't responding to the `/health` endpoint after 5+ minutes of attempts

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Configuration Fix
**File**: `backend/app/database.py`
```python
# Before (hardcoded):
"driver": "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server"

# After (uses environment variable):  
"driver": DB_DRIVER  # Uses "ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server" from .env
```

### 2. Enhanced Startup Testing
**File**: `backend/startup_test.py` (NEW)
- Comprehensive startup testing during build phase
- Tests environment variables, imports, database connection, FastAPI app creation
- Helps identify issues before deployment completes

### 3. Improved Build Configuration
**File**: `nixpacks.toml`
```toml
[phases.build]
cmd = '''
echo "=== QuantumCertify Build Phase ==="
cd backend && python startup_test.py || echo "Startup test completed with some warnings - continuing deployment"
echo "=== Build phase completed ==="
'''
```

### 4. Enhanced Server Startup Logging
**File**: `backend/run_server.py`
- Added detailed startup diagnostics
- Environment variable checking
- Better error reporting with full tracebacks
- More informative emoji-based logging

### 5. Added Missing Dependencies
**File**: `backend/requirements.txt`
```
httpx==0.27.2  # For FastAPI TestClient testing
```

## Expected Results

After redeployment:

1. ✅ **ODBC Driver**: Application will use correct "ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server"
2. ✅ **Startup Testing**: Build logs will show detailed test results for each component
3. ✅ **Better Diagnostics**: More informative error messages if issues occur
4. ✅ **Health Endpoint**: Should respond correctly at `/health`
5. ✅ **Database Connection**: Should connect to Azure SQL Server successfully

## How to Redeploy

1. **Commit all changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway healthcheck issues - ODBC driver version and startup testing"
   ```

2. **Push to trigger new deployment**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Monitor Railway Dashboard**:
   - Watch build logs for startup test results
   - Look for "ODBC Driver 18" in installation logs
   - Check for successful health endpoint response
   - Verify application starts and passes healthcheck

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist, check Railway logs for:
- Startup test results (should show which components pass/fail)
- ODBC driver installation confirmation
- Environment variables presence
- Database connection attempts
- FastAPI app initialization messages

The startup test script provides detailed diagnostics for each component and will help identify exactly what's failing.
